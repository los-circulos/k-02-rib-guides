# k-02 rib guides

Simple rib guides to use as jig while building airplane model wings. Current files are for 2mm ribs, with 50mm and 47mm rib distance.

Originally designed to build semi-simmetrical wings around 900-1000mm wingspan for control line. The two slightly different rib spacing is to make the outer wing slightly smaller.

Set guides at 45 degrees, or use overlapping guides at different angles for best results. Add a spar of 3x3mm over the url bar or glue two similar pieces at an angle to improve strength and precisity.

Make a longer guide by chaining the guides. Simply overlap guides over 2-3 ribs. At wing center, overlap two different spacing guides over just one rib.

Suggested material: 2-3mm plywood or similar. Don't use balsa. Lay down with horizontal grain (eg grain direction should match url bars).

## Formats explained:
 - rib-guide-A-BxC-x.y.* - this is a set of guides with A mm and B mm spacing, and C mm thick ribs. At the end is the version, x.y
 - rib-guide-*.svg - "plain svg" as saved by inkscape. I use laserGRBL to directly import it
 - rib-guide-*-RASTER.svg - raster overlay containing description
 - rib-guide-*.nc - laserGRBL project file. The settings might or might not be compatible with your laser.

    might not work for you directly. In that case just use the vector files
    and compile your own format
